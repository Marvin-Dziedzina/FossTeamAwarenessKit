## Main Purpose

FOSSTAK is a open source map tool to coordinate operations and let your team know what is going on.

## Scope

* The application will use OpenStreetMaps as its map provider.

* The application will provide tools for drawing Lines, Curves and several shapes on the Map.

* The application will provide [Nato Markers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO_Joint_Military_Symbology) to place on to the map.

* The application will provide the functionality to take or upload pictures and position them on to the map. The facing direction will be shown and saved. The pictures will have the same functionality as the base map so you can upload maps and house plans.
